Usage: ./configure [-h]
Options:
-h  Show the usage message.
Environment:
LIBCRYPTO      The location of the libcrypto library.
               Default: "${LOCALBASE}/lib/libcrypto.a"
LIBSSL         The location of the libssl library.
               Default: "${LOCALBASE}/lib/libssl.a"
LIBTLS         The location of the libtls library.
               Default: "${LOCALBASE}/lib/libtls.a"
LOCALBASE      The path prefix of the already installed depenencies.
               Default: "/usr/local".
OPENSSLINCDIR  The location of the LibreSSL headers.
               Default: "/usr/local/include".
